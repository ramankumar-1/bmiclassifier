Classification Machine Learning Model to predict BMI (On an Index from 0-5) on the basics of Height &amp; Weight

Dataset taken from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/bmidataset
This Model works on this data which contains the Weight, Height, Gender and the BMI Index(From 0 to 5 range)
About the dataset: -
Gender : Male / Female
Height : Number (cm)
Weight : Number (Kg)
Index :
0 - Extremely Weak
1 - Weak
2 - Normal
3 - Overweight
4 - Obesity
5 - Extreme Obesity

Algorithm Used - This ML model uses the classification model (Logistic Regression) with Python as the language. 
It predicts the Index( of BMI) on the basis of Height and Weight. 
The data is split into 70% Training and 30% testing data
